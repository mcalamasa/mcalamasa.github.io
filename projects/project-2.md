This ping pong game is made with verilog, a basys3 board, and a monitor. 

Pong is a one player ping pong game. Instead of bouncing the ball from one player to another, the user bounces the ball against the walls and prevents it from passing the bar. Of course the game would be a bit boring if a doesn't get harder, so after every ten seconds the user havent lost, the ball moves faster. 

This was very difficult for me and my team, becuase we had to learn how to implement the game on a monitor. We did a lot of research and small side projects just to understand the basic workings of a monitor. I learned the great importance of physical team meetings, not only to make sure we're all working on the project, but also for better communication. 


Vacay is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 415, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
