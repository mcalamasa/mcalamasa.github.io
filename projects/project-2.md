This ping pong game is made using verilog, a basys3 board, and a monitor. 

  Pong is a one player ping pong game. Instead of bouncing the ball from one player to another, the user bounces the ball against the walls and prevents it from passing the bar. Of course, the game would be a bit boring if a doesn't get harder, so after every ten seconds the user haven't lost, the ball moves faster. 

  This was very difficult for me and my team, becuase we had to learn how to implement the game on a monitor. We did a lot of research and small side projects just to understand the basic workings of a monitor. I learned the great importance of physical team meetings, not only to make sure we're all working on the project, but also for better communication. I also got more familiar with verilog, xilinx, and programming a board.
