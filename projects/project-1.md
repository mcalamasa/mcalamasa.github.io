Overtime restaurants and shops have made applications that allow their customers to view and shop for their items without leaving their homes. My café does just that, but for an imaginary café. It communicates with the user using text. It is implemented with object oriented programming and runs on terminal.

The user is able to see the menu and make an order. To replicate ordering from an actual café, the user can specialize their order by adding or omitting ingredients. After ordering, the user is provided with a receipt containing what they ordered, the prices of each item, and the total price for their order.

I was in charge of programming the user information. The user is either a customer or an owner of the café. The user is able to do things depending on which type they are. An owner can add seasonal items and delete old items.

My team decided to use a divide and conquer technique. I learned to organize and adjust my code to be able to run with the rest of the team’s code. Although we were working on different parts, we met regularly to discuss problems and bounce ideas off each other. This project was done in C++, so it helped me better understand private and public properties of a class and how to access them. I also learned to comment my code in a way to enable my team understand what a patch of code does and edit it if needed.
