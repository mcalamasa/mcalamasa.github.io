 Coding without using a coding standard is like a Fabreezee commercial. Random people are asked to volunteer in a Fabreezee experiment. If they agree, they are brought into a filthy room with a blindfold on. They then proceed to sniff around and explain what they are smelling. They all describe pleasant aromas because the room has been sprayed with Fabreezee. Finally, they take off the blindfold fold and are surprised to see all the dirt and filth.

 Having a code that compiles and works as intended without using a coding standard is like a filthy room sprayed with Fabreezee. Once your collaborators or boss opens up your code, it's like taking the blindfold off.

# Why are coding standards important
- looks pretty and easy to read
- other people or even you yourself can read it easily
- in turn you/collaborators can easily update and maintain
- easier to look for bugs


# My experience

 Remember all those times your code wouldn't compile because you forgot a semicolon or a curly bracket somewhere in your code? This is a very common error many programers have
 - only negative thing is all the spaces you have to remember to put

# Final Thoughts
I believe computer engineering brings many possibilities. By gaining lifelong learning skills, not only will I stay updated in software developments, but also with the younger generation. Hopefully I won't be totally confused with technology and be compared to a grandma years from now. I am excited for all the experiences I will have with the people in my field. Overall, no matter the direction I take with computer engineering, I hope to create products that I am proud of and can financially benefit me.
