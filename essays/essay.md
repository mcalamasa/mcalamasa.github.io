- efficient and simple, free
- They provide a consistent UI design for developers who lack design skills, which is great for things like intranet sites or documentation
- It is easy to fall into the trap of only learning the framework and not learning how to develop. You often miss out on valuable experience with the underlying technology. If youâ€™re not already an expert, it is important to understand the code which powers the framework. This knowledge will make life a lot easier when you run into complex challenges and will make you a better developer overall.
- Updating may introduce conflicts with your code
When it comes to updates,at the mercy of the framework developers. Sure, you can choose not to update, but you then risk falling behind.


 Throughout my education, the routine when learning somethign new is to learn the concept ----, then you learn the shortcuts. In calculus, when learning how to calculate the area under a curve, we first learned about riemann sums, then about integrals. Riemann sums were important, becuase it taught us the concept of what taking an integral is. 
 When you completely understand a concept and you're somewhat adept in it, you start to look for short cuts. UI frameworks are basically short cuts. 

# My Experience With Semantic UI
  - spent hours trying to make something in the middle of the screen, but what i can just used centered
  - the classes for semantic actually make sense, so you can basically just try to describe what you want and its probably going ot be a semantic class.]
  
 I've only recently learned about implementing user interphases. To be honest, raw html and css is a pain. Imagine wanting to make an image on the center of the screen. When using raw html and css, you would have to guess the padding for the top and the left. Of course your guess would be wrong and you would have to slowly add padding until it finally looks like it's in the center. Unfortunately, when you change the size of the page, your image is no longer in the middle and all the work and time you put into this has been wasted. If only you could just say that the object is in the middle. 
 Well, with Semantic UI, you can. With Semantic UI, you no longer have to guess measurements, manually adjust everytihng, or even build everything. Need an image to be centered?  Just add a UI class "centered". Want an input object that is connected to a button? Use the semantic class "ui icon input". Want a tab that provides a user with multile options when they click on it? Use the semantic class "ui dropdown". In fact, you can go on the <a href="https://semantic-ui.com" alt="Semantic website">Semantic website</a> and see the exact code used to implement elements, views, modules, etc, code that you can copy and paste int yours and input the information you need. 
 Semantic UI is not hard to learn at all. The website basically has everytihng you need to know.

# Should you use a UI framework?
There are a lot of pros and cons of a UI framework. Frameworks are made to 
While I am just implementing simple recreation projects, where I recreate or create a simple webpage, UI frameworks are a god send. Overall, if you are an experienced developer and you understand the underlying technology and hte cose that powers the framework, you should refrain from only learning the framework.

 Coding standards benefit everyone. Think of a text, would you rather read one extremely long paragraph or multiple small paragraphs? Coding with coding standards make your code more appealing and easy to read. It would be easily maintained, updated, and debugged. Most importantly, others would be able to understand your code. Some codes aren't only going to be yours. Whether you are working in a group or passing your code to someone else to work on, it is very important to use coding standards so others can understand your work. Coding standards result in code that is efficient in both time and cost. If you want your code to be praised, use coding standards.
