A contributing factor in my decision to major in computer engineering is my belief in computers being our future. Computers enable us to do so many things. The huge desktops they had way back when are incomparable to the small mobile devices we call cellphones today. Not only were we able to shrink a computer to fractions of what they used to be, but it is also capable of many more things. 

# Lifelong Learning 
With the ever evolving computers, it is important to gain lifelong learning skills. With all of the different programming languages we have now, it is important to efficiently learn new languages. Computer software knowledge only stays relevant for a couple of years before something new and better comes out. I want to be able to stay updated and learn languages efficiently.

# Skills
There are so many possibilities with software engineering, thus there are so many things I am interested in. I am intrigued in cyber security. Our devices contain very important information about us and it is important to make sure no one's privacy is being invaded. I am also very interested in web and game development. I would like to be able to make respoonsive websites, but I would rather develop apps. Whether they be games or informative apps, I want them to be buildable to continuously add features and updates.

# Final Thoughts 
I believe computer engineering brings many possibilities. By gaining lifelong learning skills, not only will I stay updated in software developments, but also with the younger generation. Hopefully I won't be totally confused with technology when I become a grandma. I am excited for all the experiences I will have with the people in my field. Overall, no matter the direction I take with software engineering, I hope to create products that I am proud of and can financially benefit me.
