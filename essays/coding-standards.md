 Coding without using a coding standard is like a Fabreezee commercial. Random people are asked to volunteer in a Fabreezee experiment. If they agree, they are brought into a filthy room with a blindfold on. They then proceed to sniff around and explain what they are smelling. They all describe pleasant aromas because the room has been sprayed with Fabreezee. Finally, they take off the blindfold fold and are surprised to see all the dirt and filth.

 Having a code that compiles and works as intended without using a coding standard is like a filthy room sprayed with Fabreezee. Once your collaborators or boss opens up your code, it's like taking the blindfold off.

# Why are coding standards important
- looks pretty and easy to read
- other people or even you yourself can read it easily
- in turn you/collaborators can easily update and maintain
- easier to look for bugs


# My experience

 Remember all those times your code wouldn't compile because you forgot a semicolon or a curly brace somewhere in your code? Ask any programmer and they would be able to relate to your struggles. When I first started writing code I almost always had this problem. I eventually typed both start and end curly braces first, then wrote the code block. I also made the end curly brace on its own line. So already, I made my own little coding standard.

 Using ESLint on Intellij has been a bit painful, mainly because making sure theres a space in all the right places is very tedious. Other than that, I enjoy using ESLint because I end up with a code that is pleasant to look at. Also, it helps me stay consistent.

# Final Thoughts
I believe computer engineering brings many possibilities. By gaining lifelong learning skills, not only will I stay updated in software developments, but also with the younger generation. Hopefully I won't be totally confused with technology and be compared to a grandma years from now. I am excited for all the experiences I will have with the people in my field. Overall, no matter the direction I take with computer engineering, I hope to create products that I am proud of and can financially benefit me.
